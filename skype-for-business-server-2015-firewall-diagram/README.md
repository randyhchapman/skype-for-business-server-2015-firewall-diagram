Skype for Business Server 2015 Firewall Diagram
===============================================

            

Who would have thought that after just 16 months that almost 5,000 of you would have downloaded my
[Firewall Diagram for Lync Server 2013.](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/lync/Lync-2013-Firewall-Diagram-9a7e3c92)  So flattered that so many have found it useful.  And a big thank you for those of you that have shared, liked and praised it.


To carry on the tradition I have done a new one for Skype for Business Server 2015.  As it is built on Lync Server 2013 nothing has changed (in the scope of the diagram).  It is based on the same network
 as the [Lync 2013 diagram](http://lynciverse.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/firewall-rules-and-data-flow-for-lync.html).  It uses my [Skype for Business Server Stencils](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/lync/Skype-for-Business-Server-0a9a7bb4).
